    <h1>
  Making mead is pretty simple!
    </h1>    
    
    <h2>
      You need:
    </h2>
    
    <ul>
    
      <li> Water</li>
      <li> Honey</li>
      <li>Yeast (Either baking yeast, if you want to make it really cheap, or use pure yeast) </li>
      <li>A suitable container which it can ferment it (e.g water bottles with atleast 1.5 Liters)</li>
      <li>A one sided went (keeps germs out and your mead from becoming vinegar, unless you want vinegar)</li>
      <li>A place with no light that also has a radiator somewhere</li>
      <li>A hopper (to make it easier for you to funnel it inside the container)</li>
      <li>A ballon (If you have no one-sided-went</li>
      
    </ul>

      How to make it:
    </h2>
    
    First you want to make sure that you have enough honey, you should always get 1/3 of the ammount of water you are going to use, the first time i went for it, I used about 1.5 Litres of water and 500 Grams of honey. 
    
    <p>
     Important! The honey you choose will take severe effects on how the mead will taste later. If you use a really sweet honey or rape honey, you will taste it later. Sweet honey will also take longer to process into alcohol due to more sugar beeing inside the bewerage, this will result in a more alcoholic mead. In the end it is up to you what you decide you do with you mead.
    </p>

      What you want to start of with is weighting  your honey, you can use as much as you want, but remember 1/3 is always the best and most balanced result. Proceed to make a bit space inside your water bottle so there is  a bit of air in between the water and the cap. Also keep in mind that the honey will use a bit of space aswell. If you want to make it a bit easier to get the honey inside the bottle, heat it up a bit so it get's more liquid. After the honey is inside the water, start mixing things up, shaking the bottle for about 3 or 5 minutes. If the water has mixed with the honey after you likings you can start to heat up some water. Either you heat it up inside a pot to about 35 degrees (check what the package of your yeast says, to make sure not to kill it) or you use your water tap and a thermometer. Then mix in the yeast in correlation to your ammount of honey-water-mixture. Keep stirring until all the little  lumps of mead have dissolved and pour it into your container.
    
   <p>
     Now comes the tricky part. If you went for the cheap method and used a water bottle. Cut the cap so your one sided vent fits inside and blocks of any oxygen from entering. Depending on the one sided vent you are using you have to act differently. If you have no one-sided-vent at hand you can use a ballon. First poke some holes into the ballon and put it over the bottle neck. The CO2 that is produced by the yeast can exit the bottle safely without getting any germs inside of it.
   </p>
    
    All you gotta do now is wait. Always check on your mead and take tests, to see how far the mead has fermented. The mead should be ready to consume after about 2 weeks or if you want it less sweet, after 3 weeks
  
  <p>
    I wish you good luck and happy brewing. I would recommend to make small ammlunts before you start with bigger projects, to see how it works out for you.
